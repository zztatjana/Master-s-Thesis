# Master-s-Thesis: DAC Deployment

The Supplementary Materials folder contains the code used, as well as the additional Excel files created and used for the analysis of the Master's thesis "Analyzing Technology Diffusion Pathways for the Deployment of Direct Air Capture in Meeting Global Climate Targets".

It should be mentioned that the code was created based on the code already available from Odenweller et al. (2022) (https://github.com/aodenweller/green-h2-upscaling). Also, new subcodes were created for the simulations of the social implicit factors (capacity- and year-shift), which must be run through individually to obtain the corresponding results.
